# Introductory HTML and JavaScript

*In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping
readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey
and to navigate around the document. So, in order to learn how
to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to
structure documents.*

## HTML : HyperText Markup Language

*The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.*

| What | Why | How
| :---: | :---: | :---:
| wrap our text with tags | Add contact to the webpage | using Tag
| No WYSIWYG | structure Webpage | opining Tag <>
|  |  | Closing Tag </>
|  |  | Self closing Tag

## Summary structure

- HTML pages are text documents.
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value.
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

## Markup

- DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
- You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.
- The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
- The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
- <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
- The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
- Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.

## Layout

*For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group
together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a
header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes
to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.*

**Example HTML5 LAYOUT**

- <!DOCTYPE html>   
- <html>  
- <head>  
 <title>HTML5 Layout</title></head>
- <body>
- <div>
- <header> </header>
- <section><article><figure><img src="example.jpg"/>
  </figure> </article></section>
- <footer></footer>
- </div>
- </body>
-</html>


### Summary HTML5 LAYOUT
- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
- The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.

## Process & Design

discusses a process that
you can use when you are creating a new
website.
- It looks at who might be visiting your site and how to ensure
the pages feature the information those visitors need. It also
covers some key aspects of design theory to help you create
professional looking sites. In this chapter, we will look at:  
●● How to understand the audience your site may attract and
what information they will expect to find on it.  
●● How to organize information so that visitors can find what
they are looking for  
●● Design theory for presenting information in a way that
helps visitors achieve their goals  
●● Design tips to help you create more attractive and
professional sites  
●● Why People Visit YOUR Website ?  
●● What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve ?  
●● What Information Your Visitors Need ?

### Summary
- It's important to understand w XX ho your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
- You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.

*JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.*

- **Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript language itself, you need to become familiar with some key concepts in computer programming. They will be covered in three sections:**

- A

*What is a script and how do I create one?*

- B

*How do computers fit in with the world around them?*

- C

*How do I write a script for a web page?*

- Once you have learned the basics, the following chapters will show how the JavaScript language can be used to tell browsers what you want them to do.

-------

- A SCRIPT IS A SERIES OF INSTRUCTIONS
- A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. You could compare scripts to any of the following:

- **RECIPES**  
By following the instructions in a recipe, one-by-one in the order set out, cooks can create a dish they have never made before.

Some scripts are simple and only deal with one individual scenario, like a simple recipe for a basic dish. Other scripts can perform many tasks, like a recipe for a complicated three-course meal.

Another similarity is that, if you are new to cooking or programming, there is a lot of new terminology to learn.
