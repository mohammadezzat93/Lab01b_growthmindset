## Function

*Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.*

## Defining functions  

### Function declarations 
---

A **function definition** (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

- The name of the function.  
- A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.  
- The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.
For example, the following code defines a simple function named square  

## syntax
**function square(number) {  
  return number * number;  
}**


### Function expressions 
---

*While the function declaration above is syntactically a statement, functions can also be created by a function expression.*

- A function expression is very similar to and has almost the same syntax as a function declaration (see function statement for details). The main difference between a function expression and a function declaration is the function name, which can be omitted in function expressions to create anonymous functions.

## syntax

**var sum = number  
var name = function (){  
  code ...
  return  
}**
