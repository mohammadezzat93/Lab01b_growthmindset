# MARKDOWN

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. **Markdown** is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.

**Markdown** is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.
