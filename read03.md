# Markup  
HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like **<h1>** and **</h1>**, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example **<img>**. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).
